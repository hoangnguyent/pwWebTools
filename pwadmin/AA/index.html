<br>To make auto announcement work you must add it to your cron configuration:<br>
{to edit what the announcement actually says edit /pwAdmin/AA/aa1.jsp}<br>
(/etc/crontab) example:<br>
</center>
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab<br>
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'<br>
# command to install the new version when you edit this file<br>
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,<br>
# that none of the other crontabs do.<br><br>

SHELL=/bin/sh<br>
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin<br><br>

The preceeding example (adding the line in red) would make your auto announcement run once an hour, on the hour...<br>
The format is as follows:<br>
<font color="008000">M = Minute [0-59] - This controls what minute of the hour the command will run<br></font>
<font color="0000ff">H = Hour [0-23] - This controls what hour of the day the command will run<br></font>
<font color="b8860b">DOM = Day of Month [1-31] - This controls what day of the month the command will run<br></font>
<font color="8b008b">MON = Month [1-12]or[Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec] - This controls what month of a year the command will run<br></font>
<font color="a52a2a">DOW = Day of Week [0-6]or[Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat] - This controls what day of the week the command will run<br></font>
<font color="00cc00">USER = User [root] - This is the user who runs the command<br></font>
<font color="808080">CMD = Command [/etc/cron.pw/aa1.sh] - This is the command you desire to run<br></font>
* = Wildcard - This is for not assigning a specific variable to a parameter<br>

More examples (adding the following lines would):<br>

<font color="red">

You can also make more than one by merely duplicating<br>/pwAdmin/AA/aa1.jsp ==> /pwAdmin/AA/aa2.jsp (edit for new announcement)<br>&<br>/etc/cron.pw/aa1.sh ==> /etc/cron.pw/aa2.sh (edit so it points to new [aa2].jsp)<br>and so on (just do not forget to also add them to crontable as well!)
